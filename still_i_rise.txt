Rising

#verse 1
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

#verse 2
Super awesome new verse yo

#verse 3
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.
